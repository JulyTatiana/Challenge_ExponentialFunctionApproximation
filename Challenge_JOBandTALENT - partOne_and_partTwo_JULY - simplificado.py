Challenge: Exponential function approximation

"""


"""
                    Part One of the Challenge:
    
Here we calculate exponential function WITHOUT using math.exp.

1. Build a program that given x and n would approximate e^x using the identity above.
That is only using sums, multiplications and divisions (exponentials are not allowed
by definition). You can use any programing language you like (it could be excel if
you want).

                    Part Two of the Challenge:
    
Here we calculate exponential function using math.exp only to compare with the summation result.

2. What should be the value of n in order to calculate up to 9 decimals?

Answer: It depends of the X value, so an N number of summation to calculate up to 9 decimals could be different for e^{2} and for e^{10}
